The Persession aspect instantiation model purpose is the have a dedicated aspect instance per specific user session. 
It implements the DynamicPerscope interface. 
As with any standard J2EE web application an HTTP Filter is implemented: PersessionWebFilter.
This filtered is registered in web.xml deployment descriptor. In this example it is mapped to intercept every request to
this web application.
The basic idea is that the filter put the HTTP request on the thread local storage.
The Persession fetches the request from thread local when needed and stores/fetches the aspect instance in/from there.
